# Technical Assessment -Connect the Dots

## How to run

First you need to download the dependencies for the server:

```sh
cd ./server
npm install
```

Next, you need to build a working version of the script for the server:

```sh
npm run build
```

To run the client part, you need go to the **/client** directory and open the **index.html** in your browser.

## Technologies used
- Languages: **TypeScript** / **JavaScript**
- **Node.js** - runtime environment for JavaScript
-  **Nodemon** - tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes
- **tsc** for compile TypeScript code into JavaScript
- **Webpack** - bundles the application into a single file to be used in index.html
